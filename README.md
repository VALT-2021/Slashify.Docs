# Slashify Privacy Policy

Last updated and effective: April 16, 2020

This privacy policy applies to the Discord bot Slashify#2678.

Slashify does not automatically store data. When the /create and /modify commands are used to manage the server's Interaction Commands, the server ID, command ID, and command response data is stored in the bot's database. No other data relating to the server is stored. Slashify never stores data specific to users. To delete a Interaction Command and its data, use the /delete command.

The command data is stored only for the bot to function and is not shared with anyone else or used for any other reason. The data is stored on Google Cloud.
